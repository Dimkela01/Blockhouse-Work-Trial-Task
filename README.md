## 🔍 Key Features

- Analytical modeling of slippage using order book data  
- Piecewise quadratic approximation of the slippage function  
- Smart adaptive allocation algorithm balancing urgency and slippage  
- Baseline naive allocation strategy for comparison  
- Visualizations of slippage functions and allocation behavior
